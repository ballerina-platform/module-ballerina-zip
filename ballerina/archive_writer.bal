// three calls into the archive underneath, which holds one entry open at a time, and the sequence
// cannot be held under a lock: Ballerina will not have the array or the stream the content comes from
// crossing into a lock statement. The channels of `ballerina/io` are stateful in the same way and
// none of them is isolated either, so the promise is dropped rather than paid for. One writer belongs
// to one strand, and nothing here tries to make sharing one work.
